A large, well-defined {lytic} lesion in the iliac wing is seen, which does contain a sclerotic margin and does not appear to abut any articular surface. The {pelvis} is a good location for [giant cell tumor]  which this proved to be at biopsy.

<img src="figure_40.21.jpg" />	Nonossifying Fibroma. A. A well-defined, {lytic} lesion that is minimally {expansile} is seen in the distal {tibia} in this child who was examined for a sprained ankle. B. A CT examination showed apparent cortical destruction (arrow), which was believed to be suggestive of an aggressive lesion. Biopsy showed this to be a [nonossifying fibroma]  Both CT and MR will often show apparent cortical destruction, which is merely cortical replacement by benign fibrous tissue.
<img src="figure_40.22.jpg" />	Healing Nonossifying Fibroma (NOF). A predominantly sclerotic lesion, which is minimally {expansile} and well defined, is seen in the proximal humerus in this child who is {asymptomatic}  This is a typical appearance of a disappearing or healing NOF. With time, this lesion will melt into the normal bone and essentially disappear.
<img src="figure_40.23.jpg" />	Nonossifying Fibroma (NOF). This large, well-defined {lytic} lesion with faint sclerotic margins is seen in the distal femur. Because of its size, many thought it was not an NOF. The lesion underwent biopsy and was found to be an NOF.

A {lytic} {expansile} lesion involving the right T-12 pedicle (arrow) and transverse process is seen on this anteroposterior plain film in (A) which is seen on the CT scan (B) to extend into the vertebral body. It has intact cortices and contains some calcified matrix. This is a classic example of an [osteoblastoma] of the spine.

Biopsy showed this to be a [renal metastasis]  A significant number of metastatic lesions can have a completely benign appearance, as in this example.
<img src="figure_40.26.jpg" />	Multiple Myeloma. A. A {diffuse} {permeative} pattern is present throughout the femur in this patient with multiple [myeloma]  B. A lateral {skull} film shows a typical presentation of multiple [myeloma] in the {skull} with multiple small holes throughout the calvarium, which are well defined.
<img src="figure_40.27.jpg" />	Plasmacytoma. A large, well-defined {lytic} lesion is seen in the left ilium (arrows) in this patient with multiple [myeloma]  This is a common location for a plasmacytoma. Like metastases, [plasmacytomas] often have a completely benign appearance.

<img src="figure_40.33.jpg" />	Solitary Bone Cyst. A well-defined {lytic} lesion is present in the proximal humerus in this child who suffered a fracture through the lesion. The location and central appearance, as well as the age of the patient, are characteristic of a [solitary bone cyst]  A piece of cortical bone has broken off and descended through the serous fluid contained within the lesion and can be seen in the dependent portion of the lesion (arrow) as a fallen fragment sign. A fallen fragment sign is said to be pathognomonic for a unicameral bone cyst.
<img src="figure_40.34.jpg" />	Solitary Bone Cyst. A well-defined {lytic} lesion, which is central in location, is seen in the proximal femur in this child. This is characteristic of a [solitary bone cyst] 
<img src="figure_40.35.jpg" />	Solitary Bone Cyst. A well-defined {lytic} lesion is seen in the calcaneus abutting the inferior surface, which is typical in location and appearance for a [solitary bone cyst]  A [solitary bone cyst] in the calcaneus occurs almost exclusively in this location and is not subject to pathologic fracture as readily as when one occurs in the proximal femur and humerus.

(A) An {expansile} {lytic} lesion is seen in the fifth metacarpal (arrows), and a second, smaller {lytic} lesion is seen in the proximal portion of the fourth proximal phalanx. This patient can be noted to have subperiosteal bone resorption, best seen in the radial aspect of the middle phalanges (B) (arrows) as indistinct, interrupted cortex. This makes the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism with multiple brown tumors most likely.
<img src="figure_40.37.jpg" />	Brodie Abscess. A. A plain film of the proximal humerus in this child with shoulder {pain} reveals a well-defined {lytic} lesion in the medial metaphysis. B. A T2-weighted MR of the humerus shows the lesion to have high signal and an associated joint effusion. The probable site of connection to the joint can be seen (arrow), which likely represents a draining abscess. Aspiration of the joint fluid revealed pus. This is a large focus of [osteomyelitis] or Brodie abscess.
